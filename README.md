From my accelerated introduction to program design class.

SIMPLE_TIC_TAC_TOE.RKT

Tic tac toe game with a computer opponent to play against.
The program starts on the player's turn, where clicking will place an X.
The game has a difficulty feature that can be changed mid-game using the number keys 0, 1, and 2. 0 represents the opponent randomly picking a spot on the board. 1 represents the opponent seeing if there are any possible moves that will win the game, and making those moves. 2 represents all functionality from difficulty 1 as well as the opponent blocking the player from winning the game. The difficulty can be changed anytime by entering these keys. 
The game will default to difficulty 0.

TRAFFIC_SIGNAL.RKT

Simulator of a changing traffic light that will alter the speed of cars driving by. There is a "billboard" functionality that will allow the user to type different messages onto the screen.
